==A Custom Logger

A library file that extends the buffered logger in rails. It adds a trace method which will output a coloured message (yellow) to the log.

==Install

place in lib file in your rails project then require in which ever environment you want.
+require 'custom_logger'+ I would recommend only using it in development!

Requires the 'colored' gem

Only tested on rails 2.0.2
